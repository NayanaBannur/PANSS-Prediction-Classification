# Clustering, Prediction and Classification of PANSS data

This project uses real data from five randomized controlled trials for patients with schizophrenia, and performs clustering, prediction and classification. 

The outcome measured during the study is a standardized scale commonly used for measuring symptom severity, called the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS has three classes of items that are assessed: Positive symptoms (7 items) which refer to an excess or distortion of normal functions (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), Negative symptoms (7 items) which represent a diminution or loss of normal functions, and General Psychopathology symptoms (16 items). Each PANSS item is rated on an ordinal scale from 1 (i.e. absent) to 7 (i.e. extreme).

Patient segmentation: The schizophrenia patients are segmented into groups using clustering to understand the different types of patients that are being treated by the proposed treatment.

Prediction: The total PANSS score (across the 30 PANSS symptoms) is predicted for the 18th-week assessments of patients in the last study.

Classification: The assessments in the final study are classified as either having passed or having been flagged for review or assigned to a clinical specialist.
